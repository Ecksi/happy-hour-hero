## Description

An app that allows users to find happy hour food and drink specials based on location or by inputting the restaurant or bar name. We built our own database and retrieved our own data so that it would work seamlessly with the front-end and be up-to-date, the main problem with similar apps. 

The app is responsive and will be a PWA in the near future allowing for users to download it onto their phones. Future goals include adding filters for seating type, type of drink or food, price range, and exact time. We plan to partner up with companies that provide other drink and food specials, such as the Passport Program, to allow users to filter results based on their preferred locations.
